# Architecture

This is the canonical reference for how SuperconducTED is put together.
If a code change conflicts with this document, either the code is wrong
or this document needs an update — propose the update via PR alongside
the code change.

## Goal

Bracket real IBM-hardware behavior across calibration cycles with
interval-valued predictions. Crisp calibration-based noise models
(including those produced by current Qiskit Aer workflows) match
hardware tightly on the calibration snapshot they were tuned on and
degrade silently when calibration drifts. SuperconducTED's research
aim is *transferability across calibration cycles* · a fuzzy inference
layer over calibration features produces a noise model ensemble whose
aggregated output is designed to track hardware behavior as the
underlying calibration evolves.

The pipeline supports both Type-1 and Interval Type-2 inference paths.
ADR-009 records the empirical winner selection as still open.

## The 6-stage pipeline

The TSK fuzzy pipeline takes one calibration snapshot in and produces
one set of `qiskit_aer.noise.QuantumError` instances out (one per
gate-qubit pair the target circuit uses).

## The no-per-shot-hook invariant

Aer's `AerSimulator` calls `NoiseModel.to_dict()` exactly once at
submission time
([`qiskit_aer/backends/backend_utils.py:cpp_execute_circuits`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/qiskit_aer/backends/backend_utils.py))
and the C++ controller takes over. There is no callback, generator, or
hook for per-shot Python re-entry into the noise model.

**Consequence.** Sample-level (epistemic) uncertainty must be realized
*at ensemble construction time*, not *at simulation time*. Any proposed
architecture that intercepts individual shots in Python is wrong by
construction. If a future contributor reaches for one, stop and re-read
this section.

This is the architectural reason `FuzzyNoiseModelEnsemble` exists at all:
each ensemble member is a regular `NoiseModel` that Aer can serialize
once; per-shot stochasticity comes from Aer's own C++ engine, while
fuzzy / epistemic uncertainty manifests across ensemble members.

## Calibration polling

The `superconducted-poll` console script archives `BackendProperties`
snapshots so the team accumulates the ≥630 historical records needed
for ANFIS training (≈ 126 trainable parameters × 5× rule of thumb).

- **Cadence**: cron-driven; one invocation per polling round. The
  script does NOT schedule itself. In cycle 1, polling runs hourly
  via GitHub Actions cron against `ibm_fez`. IBM updates calibration
  tables roughly that often.
- **Idempotency**: filename-based via UTC ISO-compact timestamps.
  `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` makes the write race-safe across concurrent cron
  invocations.
- **Failure handling**:
  - `NotImplementedError` (historical access tier denied): log + skip,
    exit 0.
  - `properties()` returns `None`: log + skip, exit 0.
  - Transient `RuntimeError`: exponential-backoff retry up to
    `SUPERCONDUCTED_HTTP_RETRIES` (default 3).
  - Auth errors: exit 1.
- **Schema**: `CalibrationSnapshot` carries `properties` (the JSON of
  `BackendProperties.to_dict()`), plus reduced JSON projections of the
  current `target` and `configuration`. For historical snapshots,
  `target_history(datetime=...)` is used when the SDK exposes it;
  otherwise `target` and `configuration` are stored as `None` to avoid
  pairing the current target with historical properties.
